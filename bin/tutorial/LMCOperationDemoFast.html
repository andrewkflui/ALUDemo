    <h3>Aim</h3>
    <p>
      The aim of this demonstration is to illustrate the operation of the LMC
      in executing instructions.  The fetch and execution cycle of executing
      each instruction is detailed step by step.  The left panel shows the
      current operation in Register Transfer Language (RTL).  It also records
      all the RTL operations taken place and the statistics of execution
      including the cycles per instruction
    </p>
    <p>
      Check the content of the Memory System and you will find a small LMC
      program preloaded.  The preloaded LMC program adds two input numbers.

    <h3>How to Start</h3>
    <p>
      Click the "Send Clock Signal" button to simulate the happening of one
      clock cycle.
    </p>
    <h3>Remarks</h3>
    <p>
      The main difference between this version and the "LMC Operation Demo" is that
      the operation PC + 1 > PC is now happening in parallel with the last operation
      in the Fetch phase.  This will reduce the number of clock cycles taken to execute
      instructions.
