    <h3>Aim</h3>
    <p>
      The aim of this demonstration is to illustrate the operation of the LMC
      in executing instructions.  The fetch and execution cycle of executing
      each instruction is detailed step by step.  The left panel shows the
      current operation in Register Transfer Language (RTL).  It also records
      all the RTL operations taken place and the statistics of execution
      including the cycles per instruction
    </p>
    <p>
      Check the content of the Memory System and you will find a small LMC
      program preloaded.  The preloaded LMC program adds two input numbers.
      Try to write or load other LMC programs

    <h3>How to Start</h3>
    <p>
      Click the "Send Clock Signal" button to simulate the happening of one
      clock cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fetch part of the fetch and execution cycle involves always the same
      RTL operations.  Only when the instruction is loaded into the Instruction
      Register would the type of the insturction known.  The Execution part
      is then happening according to the type of the instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      TThe LMC will be suspended when instruction COB is executed.  You can
      press the "Restart Computer" button to start the LMC.
    </p>
    <h3>Remarks</h3>
    <p>
      Note that the increment of PC (PC + 1 > PC) is considered to happen in
      a separated clock cycle.  This is of course not necessary because the
      operation could happen with another RTL operation in parallel.
